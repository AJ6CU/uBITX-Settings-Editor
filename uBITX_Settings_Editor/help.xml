			The heard of the uBITX transceiver is a microcontroller (MCU). The uBITX is manufactured by HF Signals (https://www.hfsignals.com/) using an Arduino Nano V3 MCU. The MCU includes flash memory of approximately 32kb as well as an 1024 bytes of Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM). The flash memory holds the firmware or program where as the EEPROM is used to store settings (e.g. calibration information, last used frequencies and modes, tuning rates, etc.).

			Although functional, the original firmware provided by HF Signals only supported a 2 line LCD As a result, Dr. Ian Lee (KD8CEC) developed an enhanced version of the firmware that provided a graphical user interface that used the screens from Nextion. www.hamskey.com documents in a blog format Dr. Lee's efforts as he developed this software.

            This appllication is designed to allow you to edit the various settings stored in the uBITX EEPROM. This application only works with KD8CEC derived firmware. The original KD8CEC is available at: https://github.com/phdlee/ubitx That version only supports Arduino Nano based version of the uBITX. For uBITX's which have had their Raduinos replaced with designs derived from AJ6CU (which includes faster processors and an external larger EEPROM), that source code (as well as the source code to this application) resides at: https://github.com/aj6cu .

            The save file created by this program is compatible with the original uBITX Memory Manager that was written by KD8CEC.
