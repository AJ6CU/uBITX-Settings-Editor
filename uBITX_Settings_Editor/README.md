This program was written using Python 3.10.4 on Windows. It requires the pySerial and the lxml libraries. Let me know if you find any other unusual dependencies.

This program will work by reading from your EEPROM and merging the resulting values into an XML template file that will provide you with a "MOD File. You can then use your favorite ediotr (preferably one with support for XML) and modify/change values (see the <value></value> tage) 

I can be reached with thru my email on QRZ or thru topics on the groups.io BITX20 group. You should also be able to raise Issues on the GitHub. Let me know if you have an issue here.
