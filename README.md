# EEPROM BACKUP/RESTORER/UPDATER FOR SYSTEMS RUNNING KD8CEC

## Purpose
This project is to provide a platform independent, open-source replacement for the KD8CEC uBITX Memory Manager (see http://hamskey.com). The uBITX Memory Manager provides the means to manage the system parameters that the KD8CEC software maintains in EEPROM (on chip for the Arduino Nano, off chip for future other MCU's). The uBITX Memory Manager also provides the critical ability to backup and restore the contents of the EEPROM. 

Unfortunately, and unlike all the rest of the KD8CEC family of software, the source code to the uBITX Memory manager was never released nor was it natively ported to platforms other than Windows. The last release of the tool (V1.110) happened about 3.5 years ago. 

The latest release of uBITX Memeory Manager is hosted at:
https://github.com/phdlee/ubitx/releases/download/v1.11/uBITX_Manager_V1.11.zip

I had originally not planned to tackle this task. However, in porting KD8CEC v1.2 to new hardware platforms, the uBITX Memory Manager started to show what looked like incompatibilities (e.g., works with the Arduino IoT, fails with the Arduino BLE and RP Connect). So I was left with no choice but to take this detour...

## IMPLEMENTATION
The code is being written in Python. Eventually, using standard Python tools, I expect to be able to generate an executable for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. This family tools is envisioned to be 4 programs:

- uBITXgeneratebackup: this generates a binary file of the contents of your EEPROM. This file is compatible with the existing backup file generated by uBITX Memory Manager.
- uBITXrestorefrombackup: This takes the binary backup file, either generated by the original uBITX Memory Manager or the uBITXgeneratebackup command above and writes it your EEPROM.
- uBITXgeneratemodfile: This program takes the existing contents of the EEPROM, merges it into a commented XML document. Subsequently, the end user can modify/tailor to their needs.
- uBITXapplymodfile: This takes the tailored modfile (XML) and updates the EEPROM

There needs to be a GUI based tool and I am now considering options in how to implement it. The idea that users will have to directly modify an XML file to tailor their system is going to create a never-ending set of problems as people accidently delete characters, comment beginning/endings, or even whole sections. It is a major weakness of the current situation.

## STATUS
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! People familiar with software development, XML, and Python, that also have solid backups of their EEPROM using the existing uBITX Memory Manager, are welcome to try it out and report any issues.

As of 11/4/2022, I believe that I have basic full functionality completed on all 4 of the commands above. I have also provide a GUI version for the backup and restore commands. Should shortly have a similar GUI front end for the two programs that cerate and write the XML files that users can modify.


## SCHEDULE FOR REMAINING TOOLS
After providing a basic GUI interface for all 4 tools, I will proceed to write a GUI editor for the "modfiles" to eliminate the need (and risk) of users hand modifying XML files. 

## USING THE TOOLS
To use either tool at this stage, you need to know how to use an editor, install python packages, and run python. I happen to be using PyCharm, but admit my ignorance might have led me not to choose the optimal tool. Specific values that need to be changes, are identified in the README files in the appropriate directory.

I can be reached with thru my email on QRZ or thru topics on the groups.io BITX20 group. You should also be able to raise Issues on the GitHub. Let me know if you have an issue here.
